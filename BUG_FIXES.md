## 🚀 Scripts Added

### `fix-deps.sh`
A script to reinstall dependencies with the correct versions:
```bash
chmod +x fix-deps.sh
./fix-deps.sh
```

## ✅ Current Status

All TypeScript errors have been resolved:
- ✅ Server routes are properly typed
- ✅ Client components have no unused variables
- ✅ All response handlers return consistently
- ✅ Express middleware is properly configured

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

To verify all fixes work:

1. **Install fixed dependencies:**
   ```bash
   ./fix-deps.sh
   ```

2. **Start the development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Check for TypeScript errors:**
   ```bash
   # In server directory
   cd server && npx tsc --noEmit
   
   # In client directory  
   cd client && npm run lint
   ```

4. **Test all API endpoints:**
   - GET /todos
   - POST /todos
   - PUT /todos/:id
   - DELETE /todos/:id

## 📝 Notes

- Express 4.x is more stable and has better TypeScript support than Express 5.x
- All error responses now follow a consistent format
- The application should now run without any TypeScript compilation errors
- Both development and production builds should work correctly
